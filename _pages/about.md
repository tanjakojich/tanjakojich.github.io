# Enhancing immersive experiences through user-centered research

Welcome. I’m Dr. Tanja Kojić, a UX and HCI researcher focused on immersive technologies, with expertise in user experience, accessibility, and the ethical implications of interactive systems.  
My work combines experimental design, technical implementation, and human insight to better understand how users engage with XR environments in both research and public settings.

---

## Current Focus Areas

**Trust & Safety in XR**  
Designing and evaluating user experiences in socially complex and physically shared immersive spaces.

**Human–AI Interaction**  
Studying how AI-powered avatars and assistants shape collaboration, emotion, and agency in immersive contexts.

**Ethical UX Research**  
Promoting inclusive, transparent, and participant-aware methodologies in digital twin and XR-based research.

# Enhancing immersive experiences through user-centered research

## About Me

I am Dr. Tanja Kojić, a researcher specializing in immersive technologies, human–computer interaction (HCI), and user experience (UX).  
My work bridges psychology, interaction design, and technology, focusing on how people perceive, interact with, and trust immersive systems.  
I am particularly interested in designing XR environments that are inclusive, accessible, and ethically grounded.

## Beyond Research

I enjoy transforming complex research into interactive experiences for the public and academic communities.  
Whether in a lab, a classroom, or a science festival, I strive to make immersive technologies understandable, approachable, and beneficial to a wide audience.
