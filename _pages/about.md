# Enhancing immersive experiences through user-centered research

Welcome. I’m Dr. Tanja Kojić, a UX and HCI researcher focused on immersive technologies, with expertise in user experience, accessibility, and the ethical implications of interactive systems.  
My work combines experimental design, technical implementation, and human insight to better understand how users engage with XR environments in both research and public settings.

---

## Current Focus Areas

**Trust & Safety in XR**  
Designing and evaluating user experiences in socially complex and physically shared immersive spaces.

**Human–AI Interaction**  
Studying how AI-powered avatars and assistants shape collaboration, emotion, and agency in immersive contexts.

**Ethical UX Research**  
Promoting inclusive, transparent, and participant-aware methodologies in digital twin and XR-based research.

## About Me
I am Dr. Tanja Kojić, exploring where new media and intelligent technologies meet, and how immersive solutions shape human experience across real and virtual worlds. 

As a Senior Researcher at the Quality and Usability Lab (QU Lab) at TU Berlin, my work focuses on the human side of immersive systems. I investigate how factors such as interaction design, embodiment, environment, and social context shape user experience, engagement, and acceptance. Rather than looking only at technical performance, I aim to understand how technology feels to users — whether it is intuitive, safe, inclusive, and meaningful in real-world situations. 

My research combines experimental studies, user experience evaluation, and interdisciplinary collaboration. I work closely with academic and industry partners across Europe, contributing to projects that explore immersive technologies in areas such as education, mobility, and digital culture. Alongside research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students, and about translating complex technological concepts into accessible knowledge. I strongly believe that the future of immersive technology depends not only on what is technically possible, but on what is valuable and usable for people.

## Research Focus

- **Human Experience in XR** --
Measuring, modelling, and improving user experience, performance, and well-being in immersive environments. This includes investigating presence, engagement, comfort, and technology acceptance, with a focus on understanding how immersive systems perform in real-world use and during longer-term interaction.

- **Intelligent and Multimodal Interaction** -- 
Designing adaptive, multimodal, and AI-supported interaction systems for immersive and interactive media. This includes exploring how combinations of modalities support natural, efficient, and accessible interaction in complex digital environments.

- **Real-World Context** -- 
Studying how immersive and interactive technologies are experienced, adopted, and used in real-life environments. This includes applications in domains such as education, culture, mobility, and safety, with a focus on translating technological innovation into solutions that create measurable value for users, organisations, and society.

## Beyond Research

I enjoy transforming complex research into interactive experiences for the public and academic communities.  
Whether in a lab, a classroom, or a science festival, I strive to make immersive technologies understandable, approachable, and beneficial to a wide audience.
