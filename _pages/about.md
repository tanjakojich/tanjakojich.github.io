# Enhancing immersive experiences through user-centered research

Welcome. I’m Dr. Tanja Kojić — a UX and HCI researcher focused on immersive technologies, with expertise in user experience, accessibility, and the ethical implications of interactive systems.  
My work combines experimental design, technical implementation, and human insight to better understand how users engage with XR environments in both research and public settings.
